6. Financial Time Series Analysis
What to Build: Analyze historical stock price data to forecast trends using ARIMA, GARCH, or LSTM models.
Key Features:
Perform trend, volatility, and seasonality analysis.
Build predictive models for short-term stock movements.
Visualize predictions against actual trends.
Skills Highlighted: Time series analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.

Notes:
The ARIMA model is applied to the closing prices with parameters order=(p, d, q), where:
p is the number of lag observations to include (AR term),
d is the number of differences to make the series stationary (I term),
q is the size of the moving average window (MA term).

#LSTM Model
Epochs: More epochs allow the model to learn more, but too many can lead to overfitting.
Batch Size: Affects gradient calculation. A smaller size makes the model update weights more frequently, but too small may lead to noise.
Units: More units allow for capturing more complex patterns but increase the risk of overfitting.
Layers: More layers enable the model to learn higher-level abstractions, but too many can slow down training and lead to overfitting.
Dropout Rate: Higher rates help prevent overfitting but can slow training.
Learning Rate: Affects how quickly the model learns. Too high might cause divergence, too low could slow down learning.
Lookback: Affects how much past data is used for predictions. More past data can help capture trends, but too much may cause overfitting.
