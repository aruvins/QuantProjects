Bonus:
- Using the Geometric Brownian motion formula build an understanding where the drift parameter becomes significant. 
    dS/S = μ dt + σ dZ where:
        S: Current stock price
        μ: Drift parameter (expected return)
        σ: Volatility parameter
        dt: Time increment
        dZ: Increment of a standard Brownian motion
 This project can be useful in understanding the time scale in which a trend becomes a factor to consider in trading. For example, in day trading the trend (drift) is insignificant. On the other hand, if you were understanding a stock over 10 years the trend would be important.
