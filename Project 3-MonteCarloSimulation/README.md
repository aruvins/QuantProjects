3. Monte Carlo Simulation for Risk Analysis
What to Build: A Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the potential outcomes of financial decisions, such as stock option pricing or portfolio risk.
Key Features:
Simulate asset price movements using stochastic processes like Geometric Brownian Motion.
Compare simulated results to historical data.
Visualize probability distributions and confidence intervals.
Skills Highlighted: Python, simulation modeling, financial risk analysis.


Notes:
- Notice how the means is always slightly larger than the current price. This slight offset shows how the stock market tends to go up in the long term.
