Definitions:
VaR (Value at Risk) - A statistic that quantifies the extent of possible financial losses within a firm, portfolio, or position over a specific time frame.

CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) - a risk assessment measure that quantifies the amount of tail risk an investment portfolio has.

Tail risk - a form of portfolio risk that arises when the possibility that an investment will move more than three standard deviations from the mean is greater than what is shown by a normal distribution.
